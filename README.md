## ✅ Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
🚢 Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.
- Dataset: titanic.csv  
- Techniques: Data preprocessing, Logistic Regression, model evaluation  
- Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived based on features like age, sex, passenger class, etc.
## ✅ Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
🌸 Classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
- Dataset: iris.csv  
- Techniques: Supervised learning (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree)  
- Goal: Classify iris species based on sepal and petal length and width.
## ✅ Task 4: Sales Prediction
📊 Predict sales based on advertising spend across different platforms.
- Dataset: advertising.csv  
- Techniques: Linear Regression  
- Goal: Forecast sales based on TV, radio, and newspaper ad budgets.
## 💻 Technologies Used
